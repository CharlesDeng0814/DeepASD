# DeepASD: Deep Learning-Based Integration of Multi-Omics Data for Predicting Autism Risk Genes
We proposed DeepASD, a deep learning-based end-to-end framework for integrating multi-omics data to identify ASD-associated genes.
This repo is for the source code of "Deep Learning-Based Integration of Multi-Omics Data for Predicting Autism Risk Genes". \

Setup
------------------------
The setup process for DeepASD requires the following steps:
### DeepASD
Download DeepASD.  The following command clones the current DeepASD repository from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/CharlesDeng0814/DeepASD.git
